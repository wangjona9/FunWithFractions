# FunWithFractions

Jonathan Wang

This repository contains the BigFraction object declaration (BigFraction.java), a class containing two non-static methods to calculate the result of mathematical expressions (BFcalculator.java), and two classes running the calculator class, each within their main method (InteractiveCalculator.java, QuickCalculator.java). The interactive calculator will repeatedly read a line the user types while the quick calculator takes the expressions from the command line.
